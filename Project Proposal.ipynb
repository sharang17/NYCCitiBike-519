    "Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Citbike is a privately owned bicycle sharing service located in NYC. When Citbike launched in 2013 there were 332 stations and 6000 bicycles available for use. The service has grown to an annual subscribership of approximately 164,000. Citibike logs a limited amount of data describing features such as trip time and pickup and dropoff. This data set has been visualized by some like Todd Schneider[1] but to our knowledge we have not seen any modeling of the effect of traffic congestion on mode of transportation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Project Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We hope to predict the number of citibike users at a given time based upon traffic congestion. We hypothesize that bike usage  will be correlated with the level of congestion. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Relatedly, there is some interesting analysis to be done on the effects of bicycling on traffic volume. Because we can look at taxi data before and after the introduction of Citibikes we can get some insight into how taxi ridership has been affected by bicycling. Further, we have alternate sources of traffic information that will give us further insight into traffic volume. NYC could use the results of such analysis to improve traffic patterns throughout the city.\n",

    "Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Citibike data - https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Citibike dataset is released by Citibike and contains the following columns:\n",
    "    Trip Duration (seconds)\n",
    "    Start Time and Date\n",
    "    Stop Time and Date\n",
    "    Start Station Name\n",
    "    End Station Name\n",
    "    Station ID\n",
    "    Station Lat/Long\n",
    "    Bike ID\n",
    "    User Type (Customer = 24-hour pass or 7-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)\n",
    "    Gender (Zero=unknown; 1=male; 2=female)\n",
    "    Year of Birth\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we are primarily interested in is (start station, end station), (start time, stop time) and trip duration. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxi data - http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxi data contains the following fields: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "We are primarily interested in the following fields: (Dropoff_latitude, Dropoff_longitude),  (Pickup_latitude, Pickup_longitude), (tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime), Trip_distance, and Fare_amount. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic cam data - http://data.beta.nyc/dataset/nyc-real-time-traffic-speed-data-feed-archived\n",
    "\n",
    "The traffic cam data provides Speed (average speed of vehicle traversing link) and TravelTime which provides the average travel time for a vehicle traversing the link. This will give us a second perspective on traffic congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the speed limit for a given road so we can approximate how close to 100 percent efficiency the road is operating. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic Volume - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/NYC-BigApps/Traffic-Volume-Counts-2012-2013-/p424-amsu\n",
    "\n",
    "The traffic volume data gives us a third perspective on congestion on the roads. It provides the count of vehicles that cross a particular road segment by hour. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Maps - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro#traffic-model\n",
    "\n",
    "The google maps API provides us with a way to get a google estimated time for a particular route. This will give us a baseline for comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The various data sets we have access to provide different approximations of congestion. The traffic cam data will give us the average speed at a given for a given place. \n",
    "\n",
    "    We can create a network of bicycle stations and then identify the most heavily trafficked edges. This will give us an idea of where to look for traffic data for comparison. We can select out and aggregate these trips which will give us citibike user volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "    We expect that bike and taxi usage will peak at the rush hour points of 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM. This means that we have to look to other times to validate our hypothesis because we need to separate out the effect of the commute on the absolute magnitude of users from the effects of traffic. For example, if traffic is high at 12PM on a Saturday then this would be an ideal time to check the bike usage because we would not expect a significant deviation from the norm. But if we do see a substantial deviation we believe that would substantiate our hypothesis. Not only will we be able to correlate congestion with citibike usage but we will also be able to validate or invalidate the choice to use a Citibike because we know the trip times for comparable taxi and bike journeys. \n",
    "\n",
    "    We can then use the three different data sets that we are using to approximate traffic congestion and evaluate them to determine the best combination of variables to predict citibike usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We will need to adjust usage by number of subscribers -- just because more people are using bikes doesn't mean that there is more congestion. There may be more subscribers. \n",
